# Scout Membership

Membership in Troop 3740 is open to all children between the ages of 11 and 18. Also, Webelos Scouts are welcome following BSA guidelines for joining a troop. The Scoutmaster will assign each boy to a patrol after joining the troop. Full participation in patrol activities from the outset is expected of each Scout. A scout must complete a Youth Membership Application, obtain proper signatures, and be registered with the BSA prior to taking part in any activity.

Membership in Troop 3740 may be limited due to the size of the meeting place, number of active leaders, etc. When necessary, the troop will maintain a waiting list for anyone desiring to join the troop's Scouting program. The Scoutmaster and committee chairman will also review adults expressing a desire to become leaders.
