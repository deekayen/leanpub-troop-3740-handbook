# Troop Objectives

We want to teach our Scouts to be disciplined leaders, to set the example and to stand up for what they know is right. We want our Scouts to be honest, to set high goals for themselves and to be achievers. We will provide the opportunity for every scout who has the desire, to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.

We will provide an active program. The accomplishment of this goal requires the commitment of the leaders to provide a viable program; the commitment of the Scout to perform to standard and to participate fully in the meetings, outings, summer camps, fundraisers, and service projects; the commitment of the parents to participate as leaders, merit badge counselors and other roles in support of  the troop that are vital to the functioning of the troop.

The behavior of a Scout is set forth in the Scout Law and in the Scout Oath. It is our objective to teach each Scout the meaning of the Scout Law and the Scout Oath. Any behavior that goes against the Scout Oath and Law disgraces the Scout, his parents, the adult leaders, and the troop.

The Scouting movement is designed primarily to teach the Scout worthy values as he develops his duty to God and Country, to others, and to himself.

The development of a Scout is a lengthy process and it comes in various ways. It comes from advancing  in rank, camping with other Scouts, competing with other Scouts, holding office in the patrol or troop, interacting with Scouts and leaders from other troops, and from the many other ways in which Scouting develops leadership, personality, character, and self-reliance.

The desire is for each Scout to achieve to the upper limits of his own ability. The Scoutmaster can only do so much. The Scout must be willing to work, participate, make decisions, cooperate, obey orders, and be patient. The parents must be willing to give of their time, talent, interest, and encouragement. Not every Scout will become an Eagle Scout, but every Scout should absorb many of the ideals of Scouting  and thus become a better citizen and a better individual. To these goals, we seek your support in our  endeavor.
