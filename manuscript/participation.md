# Scout Participation

Scout spirit (demonstrated by application of the Scout Oath and Scout Laws in your daily life and during all Scouting functions) and troop participation is a requirement for rank advancement. Scouts participating in cooperative and leadership roles within the troop along with the outdoor program will find that advancement is a natural result of their Scouting experience. Advancement to each rank requires  that a Scout "be active in his troop" for a specified period of time. With all of the activities that young men and women participate in these days, it is necessary to define what "active" means in Troop 3740. We keep records of attendance at all events and troop meetings. At a minimum a Scout in Troop 3740 must:

* Attend at least 50% of all regular scheduled troop meetings, outings or activities
* Participation in various service projects per year is expected

Scouts not meeting the above requirements will not be permitted to advance in rank within the troop structure. The Scoutmaster or committee chairman shall review exceptions for the ability to advance and further participate in the troop.

For a scout to get the most from his time in Scouts BSA, they need encouragement from his parents, both in words and actions. One major way that parents can help is by planning the family calendar to minimally conflict with troop activities. This allows the Scout maximum opportunity to participate in troop events. Troop 3740 has a very active camping program and schedules many events throughout the month. Annual planning of events occurs to prepare the Scouting calendar.
