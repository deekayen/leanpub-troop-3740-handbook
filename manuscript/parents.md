# Parental Responsibilities

A lot of hard work and time goes into providing a successful Scouting program for your scout. As a result, there are certain responsibilities we expect our Scouts' parents to undertake.

## Deadlines

The deadlines on permission slips, money, or any other item allow accurate and adequate planning for the logistics of trips or activities. Please do your best to encourage your scout to meet these  deadlines. Remember we are a volunteer organization and should not have to scramble at the last minute.

## Courts of Honor

The court of honor is a high point in a Scout's career -- he is receiving rank  advancements merit badges and other awards, and is being recognized for much hard work and determination. The troop also takes this opportunity to relay important information about the troop at these special ceremonies. Please make every effort to attend -- your scout and his fellow Scouts need your support.

## Troop Fundraisers

The Troop functions on fundraising. Please make every effort to have your Scout  participate. Fundraising is a growth opportunity for your Scout.

## Transportation

The Troop often needs assistance in providing transportation to and from camping trips and other events.

## Scout Support

Successful Scouts have parent support! It is vital that you let him know you are interested in his Scouting career and support his involvement in Scouting.

We encourage all parents to be involved in some way with our troop. Remember, Scouting is a family oriented organization. You may choose to serve on the troop committee, to attend camping trips, to  become a merit badge counselor, or to serve the troop in some other capacity. Whatever you can do will be appreciated by the Scouts and the other adult leaders. Also, we periodically announce special needs; if  you are available and able, please contact us.
