# Troop Discipline Policy

Because a Scout's inappropriate behavior does not demonstrate the last requirement of living by the Scout Oath and Law, the following consequences will result:

1. A parent will be contacted to pick-up the Scout from the meeting or outing;
2. Suspension from participation in troop meetings or outings;
3. Delay in rank advancement;
4. Expulsion from the troop

Behavior problems are first to be dealt with by the patrol leader. Unresolved issues should be reported to the senior patrol leader who, if needed, will call upon the Scoutmaster or an assistant Scoutmaster to help  determine the appropriate discipline. Scouts who decide to not follow directions or cannot be trusted by  adults to obey safety rules, do unfortunately exist. Those scouts who cannot adjust, become a threat or a danger to themselves or others and even place adult leaders in a liability situation. Although it is our belief that Scouting should be available for every child, we also recognize that Scouting is just not for every scout. If a scout infringes on the rights of other scouts, he actually robs them from a safe and enjoyable Scouting experience. This will not be allowed.
