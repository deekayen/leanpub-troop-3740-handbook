# The Uniform

You may have already recognized that this is one of the eight stated methods that the BSA uses as a tool to attain the aims of Scouting. It signifies membership and unity with other Scouts. It communicates  status and experience (through badges of rank, symbols of office, and participation patches in various Scouting events).

It promotes better behavior, as those dressed as Scouts more often remember to act as Scouts. It assists leaders, both scout and adult, in identifying and marshaling large groups.

In the BSA there is only one "official uniform" which is simply named "the uniform" and unofficially referred to as the "Class A" uniform. There are only two types of official uniform status; in uniform and out of uniform. From time to time, the Senior Patrol Leader or Scoutmaster may re-define the expected uniform wear for limited periods of time.

There are four parts to an official BSA uniform; official BSA socks, pants or shorts, belt and shirt with  appropriate patches in appropriate locations. Headgear and neckerchiefs are optional and are voted  upon by the troop[^altwear]. However, if wearing headgear with the official field uniform, only BSA headgear may  be worn. Scouts should wear the appropriate shoulder loops (green for Scouts BSA). The OA sash may only be worn at OA functions and when representing the OA. The merit badge sash may be worn with all Class A uniforms, but the OA sash and the merit badge sash should not be worn simultaneously. It is not proper to wear either the OA sash or the merit badge sash folded over the belt.

See the official Scouts BSA Handbook for patch placement and proper wear of the uniform.

At a minimum the uniform should bear the council shoulder patch (CSP), troop numerals (3740), the purple World Crest badge, USA Flag, current year Journey to Excellence emblem, and the appropriate patrol emblem. Rank and badges of office patches should be worn only by a Scout currently holding that rank and/or badge of office.

Unofficially, local troops and Scout camps recognize the terms, "Class B uniform" or "summer camp uniform." These terms normally refer to the official BSA socks, trousers, belt and some type of troop or Scouting t-shirt. Some units even recognize the term, "activity uniform." All of these terms are unofficial and mean different things depending on where you are (which camp, troop etc.).

Troop 3740 recognizes the Class A uniform as a khaki Scout shirt with proper insignia, Scout pants or shorts, appropriate belt, socks, and shoes.

Troop 3740's class B uniform is a troop t-shirt or other BSA shirt, pants or shorts, sneakers, and a BSA hat if one chooses.

**Shoes should always be closed toe shoes.**

A short-sleeved shirt is recommended. It can be worn over a sweatshirt or turtleneck on cold days.

**PLEASE** make sure that every piece of clothing is labeled with your scout's name. This helps us get uniforms and other items of clothing back to the proper owners when they are left at meetings and campouts.

A full uniform is expected to be worn. Is it that important? Yes. Notice that it has the same importance  as any of the other eight methods of Scouting. It ranks equally as important as an outdoor program. None of the methods by themselves are effective, and none are as effective if any are missing. Let's put it this way: Would a little league baseball team allow a player to take the field sans uniform? No.

If the uniform cannot readily be attained by the Scout, he should speak privately to the Scoutmaster. There are ways to earn a uniform.

Class A uniforms should be worn to all ceremonies, troop meetings and courts of honor, whenever en route to and from a Scouting function, and as dictated by policy or the patrol leaders council.

This may be difficult for scouts, especially in late middle school to early high school as they become self conscious about wearing the uniform. They should not be ashamed to be affiliated with the Scouts, and therefore should be encouraged to be proud of the uniform and what it stands for. The accomplishments of the scout are represented by his badges of office and the uniform helps him identify that he is a part of something greater than himself and greater than his peer group.

A clean and well maintained Class A uniform, properly worn, **is a requirement for any Scout seeking a Scoutmaster conference, or appearing before a board of review**, or a public ceremony representing  the troop or BSA in general.

You may purchase uniforms online at [scoutshop.org](https://www.scoutshop.org/), but we recommend that you purchase them at a local Scout shop in Jefferson or Lawrenceville to ensure proper fit and so you can return them if necessary. We also sometimes have 'experienced' uniforms or seconds[^experienced].

Every rank requires a scout to display "Scout spirit." One aspect of Scout spirit is wearing the uniform. Every scout in this troop has the ability to have a full uniform. Therefore, scouts choosing not to wear the full uniform are not meeting the rank requirements of "Scout spirit" and cannot attend a board of review and therefore will not advance in rank.

[^altwear]: The Troop 3740 PLC may alternately regulate headgear and neckwear â€“ in other words, this may change.

[^experienced]: Experienced means formerly owned. Seconds and experienced uniforms are not always available. Ebay is another resource for uniforms.
