# Adult Leader Responsibilities

Troop 3740 is fortunate to have a solid group of volunteers including our troop committee, Scoutmaster, and assistant Scoutmasters working to provide the Scouting program to all members of the troop. These leaders oversee the operations of the troop. They are primarily responsible for achieving two major goals:

1. Training and guidance of the Scouts consistent with the aims and objectives of the BSA; and
2. Providing a safe outdoor program for all Scouts.

Having satisfied these two key responsibilities, adult leaders then provide the Scouts with the tools to  deliver the Scouting program to themselves and their fellow Scouts.

The BSA Scoutmaster is responsible for:

* Training and guiding Scout junior leaders to run the troop
* Working with and through the assistant Scoutmasters to bring the Scouting program to the troop
* Aiding the development of the Scouts by challenging them and encouraging them to learn new things
* Guiding Scouts in planning the troop program
* Helping the troop committee recruit new assistant Scoutmasters, and
* Conducting Scoutmaster conferences

It is expected that all assistant Scoutmasters will:

* Become "Trained" within 1 year of joining the troop
* Regularly attend troop meetings
* Regularly wear the Scout uniform
* Regularly attend troop outings
* Periodically coordinate troop outings
* Attend District Roundtables (as available)
* Follow the Scout Law and Oath
* Support the troop as requested by the Scoutmaster or Committee Chair

The troop is always seeking new adult leaders. Any parents interested in getting involved as adult leaders should speak with the Scoutmaster or the troop committee chairperson for an application.
