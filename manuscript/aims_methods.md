# Aims and Methods of Scouting

Welcome to the adventure of Scouting! We are pleased that you have chosen to join the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and Scouts BSA Troop 3740. Troop 3740 has been in existence since the Fall of 2003 and has a tradition of Scouting excellence and adventure. We consistently earn the National Journey To Excellence Award. The troop lives the Scouting promise by planning outdoor activities each month, conducting community service projects and developing young men into the leaders of tomorrow. The Scouting experience helps to instill values in young people, to prepare them to make ethical choices over their lifetime and to achieve their full potential.

BSA Scout Troop 3740 operates under Scouting's values. The details of Scouting's values are covered in the **Scouts BSA Handbook**. Following are some of the highlights:

**Vision Statement** - The Boy Scouts of America will prepare every eligible youth in America to become a responsible, participating citizen and leader who is guided by the Scout Oath and Law.

**Mission Statement of the BSA** – The mission of the BSA is to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Law and Oath.

**Aims of the BSA** – To develop future leaders of strong **character**, good **citizenship**, and physical, mental, and emotional **fitness**.

**Methods of the Scouting Program** – Advancement (self-reliance-ability to help others-challenge); ideals (Scout Oath-Law-Motto-Slogan); patrols (peer groups-elected representation-activities); outdoors (all outdoor programs); adult association (image-role model-example); personal growth (Good Turn-service projects-religious emblems); leadership development (leadership skills and practice-citizenship) and  uniform (commitment to aims-identity).

## Advancement

Scouting provides a series of surmountable obstacles and steps in overcoming them through the  advancement method. The Scout plans his advancement and progresses at his own pace as he  meets each challenge. The Scout is rewarded for each achievement, which helps him gain self confidence. The steps in the advancement system help a Scout grow in self-reliance and in the  ability to help others.

Ranks are Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, Life, and Eagle.

## Ideals

The ideals of Scouting are spelled out in the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Scout motto, and  the Scout slogan. The Scout measures himself against these ideals and continually tries to improve. The goals are high, and as he reaches for them, he has some control over what and who he becomes.

## Patrols

The patrol method gives Scouts an experience in group living and participating citizenship. It places responsibility on young shoulders and teaches scouts how to accept it. The patrol method allows Scouts to interact in small groups where members can easily relate to each other. These  small groups determine troop activities through elected representatives.

## Outdoor Programs

Scouting is designed to take place outdoors. It is in the outdoor setting that Scouts share  responsibilities and learn to live with one another. In the outdoors the skills and activities practiced at  troop meetings come alive with purpose. Being close to nature helps Scouts gain an appreciation for God's handiwork and humankind's place in it. The outdoors is the laboratory for Scouts BSA to learn ecology and practice conservation of nature's resources.

## Adult Association

Scouts learn a great deal by watching how adults conduct themselves. Scout leaders can be positive role models for the members of the troop. In many cases a Scoutmaster who is willing to listen to scouts, encourage them, and take a sincere interest in them can make a profound difference in their lives.

## Personal Growth

As Scouts plan their activities and progress toward their goals, they experience personal growth.  The Good Turn concept is a major part of the personal growth method of Scouting. Scouts grow as they participate in community service projects and do Good Turns for others. Probably no device is as successful in developing a basis for personal growth as the daily Good Turn. The religious emblems program also is a large part of the personal growth method. Frequent personal conferences  with his Scoutmaster help each Scout to determine his growth toward Scouting's aims.

## Leadership Development

The Scout program encourages scouts to learn and practice leadership skills. Every Scout has the opportunity to participate in both shared and total leadership situations. Understanding the concepts of leadership helps a scout accept the leadership role of others and guides him toward the citizenship aim of Scouting.

## Uniform

The uniform makes the Scout troop visible as a force for good and creates a positive youth  image in the community. Scouting is an action program, and wearing the uniform is an action that shows each Scout's commitment to the aims and purposes of Scouting. The uniform gives the Scout identity in a world brotherhood of youth who believe in the same ideals. The uniform is practical attire for Scout activities and provides a way for Scouts to wear the badges that show what they have accomplished.

Be clean in my outdoor manners
