# Welcome to Troop 3740

*Dear Scout,*

I am proud that you have chosen to be a part of BSA Scout Troop 3740. I hope that you and your family enjoy being with us and it is my hope that our troop enjoys having you as well.

The purpose of this handbook is to give your parents and you information about our troop, our organization, and the Boy Scouts of America. The goals of Scouting are to build young men of character,  who are good citizens and are physically and morally fit. It is the sincere wish of all of us in BSA Scout Troop 3740 to accomplish these objectives while having FUN!

New Scouts need to know that in Scouting, they run the program. Scouts elect their leaders and everyone has a voice in planning activities.

Parents are also expected to take an active role in support of the troop through our weekly Scout meetings and our troop committee meetings. We all have something we can provide in support of our scout's development. Adults have the option of working with the troop as a parent or as a leader. The role of Scout leader requires training, attendance, and dedication.

There are a multitude of resources available to you, and the first sign of a good Scout is not someone who has all the answers, but someone who knows where to get the answers. This troop handbook is not a replacement for your official BSA Scout Handbook, but only a supplement. The most important piece of equipment you can own as a Scout is your BSA Scout Handbook. You should immediately get an official handbook and read it, know it, and refer to it often. Let it be your guide to Scouting.

Your parents and you should always feel free to call me or any of our assistant Scoutmasters to discuss the troop or any questions or suggestions you may have.

It is my personal goal to utilize the methods of Scouting to enter into a partnership between you the Scout, your parents, and the chartered organization to accomplish the aims of Scouting.

Yours in Scouting,

> *David Norman*
