# Merit Badge Program

Merit badges offer additional skill advancement that allows a Scout to specialize in a particular skill area such as camping, cooking, backpacking, orienteering, etc. Some merit badges may help scouts learn about a potential career path, such as aviation, dentistry, farming, forestry, health care, law, or programming.

The troop recommends that a Scout work on no more than a few merit badges at any given time, allowing them to focus on completing requirements in a timely manner. Earning merit badges is a major part of the Scout learning process, especially after they have advanced to First Class. Summer camp is an excellent way to earn merit badges, especially several hard to earn ones like camping, environmental science, and  emergency preparedness. Other than at summer camp, merit badges are earned as follows:

1. Select a merit badge. (Basic requirements for each merit badge are found in the Boy Scout requirements book. In addition, each merit badge has a pamphlet which addresses the requirements specifically for that badge â€“ some are available in the troop library.) Often requirements change for a particular merit badge, the internet is a great resource to locate current merit badge requirements and worksheets for the scouts to utilize. When a Scout begins a merit badge, they are to follow the most current requirements.
2. Approach the Scoutmaster with the merit badge that he wishes to complete.
3. Consult with the Scoutmaster or counselors for the desired badge. Only work performed after  obtaining approval from the Scoutmaster may be counted toward the merit badge. It is the Scout's responsibility to present his merit badge application (blue card) with his personnel information filled in, to the Scoutmaster for their signature and approval.
4. Contact the merit badge counselor approved by the Scoutmaster and make arrangements to meet and go over the requirements.
5. Complete all requirements to the counselor's satisfaction, using a literal interpretation of each requirement.
6. Have the blue card signed by the counselor when completed.
7. Turn in the completed blue card to the advancement chairman.
