Courts of honor are scheduled quarterly and a celebration of rank and merit badge achievement. Other awards may be given out and leaders and boys recognized for their accomplishments. Parents and siblings are encouraged to attend. Scouts should be in Class A uniform. Rank and merit badge achievements are often ordered and awarded at the quarterly court of honor, but may be given to the scout as soon as possible. They will be recognized at the court of honor for their achievements.
