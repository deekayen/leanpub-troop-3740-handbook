# Meetings and Outings

Currently, Troop 3740 meets Monday evening at 7:00 PM at the Church of the Good Shepherd on Holtzclaw Road in Cumming, Georgia. There are variations which are announced when they occur. Generally speaking, we follow the Forsyth County school system, and may not have a meeting if we do not have school. We strive to have PLC only meetings immediately following an outing.

Unless otherwise noted, the uniform for all meetings is Class A.

We Scout in the summertime! We run a year-round program. Generally, we will have a meeting every week through the year and at least one outdoor event every month. The PLC should keep the Scouts apprised of exceptions. The majority of our outings we will leave rain or shine from The Church of the Good Shepherd and return to the Church. Weather forecasts are monitored by leaders attending the outing and any adjustments are communicated. We have Troop equipment that is available for your  Scout to use on outings i.e. tents, cookware, etc. Upon returning from an outing, often times we will ask  your Scout to take home an item to clean it and return it. Please support and encourage your Scout to be  mindful of the Troop gear, to take care of it, treat it as if it were his own, and to return it in a timely  manner.

Preparations for all campouts begins in advance. Patrols will plan their patrol menu and grocery list during the troop meeting. Usually a Scout volunteers to be the grubmaster and goes shopping for the patrol. Monies for food are divided among the patrol members attending the event. Duty rosters are also completed in advance in order for the Scouts to be prepared. Adults are part of their own separate patrol from the Scouts. They will cook and perform similar duties to the Scouts patrols.

We will attend at least one long term resident camp during the summer. We try to alternate attendance at camps to provide various experiences to our Scouts. We also attempt to provide opportunities for boys to  attend high adventure programs as well.

In addition to the fun, we also do our duty to God and Country, and our duty to others. This means work, and service projects. Scouts are expected to attend not only the fun outings, but the work days and fundraisers as well.
