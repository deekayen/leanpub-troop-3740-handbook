# New Scout Patrol

A new-Scout patrol is for 11-year-olds or recently crossed over Webelos Scouts who have recently joined the troop. They function together as a patrol during their first year in the troop, working toward the goal of completing the requirements for First Class.

The Scoutmaster chooses a special assistant Scoutmaster who is especially equipped to oversee this new Scout patrol. With the advice and consent of the Scoutmaster and this assistant Scoutmaster, an older, experienced Boy Scout serves as troop guide for the new-Scout patrol.

Acting both as a leader and mentor, this experienced Scout (who must be at least First Class in rank) helps the new Scouts through the early challenges of troop membership. He provides direction, coaching, and support as determined by the skill level and morale of the members of the new-Scout patrol.

It is tremendously helpful during this time for the parent/guardian and the Scout to refer back to the aims  of the Scouting program. Although advancement is one of the eight methods of Scouting, it is not one of the aims. All too often someone (sometimes the boy but often times the parent) will become fixated with rank.

Please understand that although we seek to help all boys advance in rank, this will occur at different  rates. It is the Scout's responsibility to use their Scouts BSA Handbook and mark down completed rank requirements and seek out approval by having a First Class Scout or higher sign their handbook. Our troop's attitude is this: focus on the "outing" in Scouting. If we are truly Scouting correctly, then the rank will come. However, if we focus on making rank, then we may miss Scouting all together.
