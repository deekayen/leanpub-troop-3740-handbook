# Troop Rules

**The only rules our troop operates on are the Scout Oath and Scout Law[^onlyrule]. To a true Scout, no more explanation is necessary.**

The Scout must at all times strive to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient,  cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent. We want to bring the scouts into an understanding that as  developing young men they will at times mess up, and that is perfectly O.K. What we expect is for scouts to continuously strive to live by the Scout Oath and Scout Law and to get better at it each day.

Because they are all in different developmental stages and all come from different backgrounds, we recognize that not all the Scouts we work with have attained a full understanding of how to apply the Scout Oath and Scout Law daily. Even some parents have difficulty understanding them. For these reasons, the PLC has the authority to adopt specific troop guidelines, (not necessarily rules) to further clarify the application of the Scout Oath and Scout Law on a daily basis[^clarify]. Some of these may include but are not limited to:

* A Scout should always keep a positive attitude – *A Scout is Cheerful*.
* PLC decisions are made by a majority vote – *A Scout is Obedient*.
* The following items are prohibited on any outing or at any meeting: Gasoline or bulk liquid fuels (unless permission is first obtained), fireworks, firearms, ammunition, slingshots, and martial arts weapons – *A Scout is Courteous and Kind to others*.
* Scouts need special permission from the Scoutmaster to bring a pet of any kind to any meeting – *A Scout is Courteous to others*.
* Unless designated by the Scoutmaster (normally on long trips) electronic devices should not be  used at meetings or on any outing. Examples are radios, Nintendo Switch, hand-held games, MP3 players, cell phones, laser pointers, or any other such electronic devices. Flashlights are allowed and a GPS unit with permission. Cell phones are to be used only for calling when we are returning from our trip.
* There are times when a Scout becomes so preoccupied with an item of fancy that he mentally "checks out" from the program and becomes non-participatory. Any item which so distracts the Scout from participating in the meeting, or outing, may be disallowed for that Scout at future meetings or outings – *A Scout is Obedient*.
* Fixed blade knives or any knife with a blade longer than 3 ½” are not allowed. *Guide to Safe Scouting*.
* Open toe shoes are not allowed. *Guide to Safe Scouting*.
* Roughhousing between Scouts is discouraged. Roughhousing between a large Scout and a small Scout (in size as well as maturity), or more than one on one is totally prohibited. *A Scout is Kind*
* No profanity at any troop meeting or activity – A Scout is Courteous, and Reverent.
* No throwing anything – no rocks, pine cones, water – anything – *A Scout is Courteous and Kind*
* "Stick etiquette" will be practiced at all times – if it goes into the fire it stays in the fire – it is used  to hit someone, you lose stick privileges. The Outdoor Code – *A Scout is Courteous*
* Hazing, initiations and secret societies and clubs are prohibited – *A Scout is Courteous and Kind*.
* Use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs is prohibited – *To Keep myself physically strong and mentally awake*.
* Scouts will follow instructions from youth leaders. If a Scout does not like a rule or duty, the Scout may protest in an appropriate manner by discussing it with his patrol leader, senior patrol leader, or Scoutmaster (in that order) – *A Scout is Loyal and Obedient*.
* Youth protection guidelines will at all times be followed – *Duty to other people and to self*.
* Proper respect will always be shown during religious and flag ceremonies – no talking or horseplay during religious or patriotic services – *A Scout is Reverent*.

[^onlyrule]: The Scout Oath and Scout Law are listed in the first pages of the Boy Scout Handbook
[^clarify]: These "rules" should never cause the troop to become legalistic or should take the place of the Oath and Law.
