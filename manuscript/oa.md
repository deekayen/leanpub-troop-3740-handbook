# Order of the Arrow

The Order of the Arrow is the BSA's national honor society and is a large part of the total program of Troop 3740. Entrance into the OA is obtained through elections held once a year in each troop for youth members and by appointment by the Scoutmaster and troop committee chairman for adults. The purpose of the OA is to recognize those campers, Scouts and Scouters, who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives and by such recognition, cause other campers to conduct themselves in such manner as to warrant recognition.

* To develop and maintain camping traditions and spirit.
  * To promote Scout camping, which reaches its greatest effectiveness as a part of the unit's camping program, both year-round and in the summer camp, as directed by the camping committee of the council.
* To crystallize the Scout habit of helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to  others.

Troop 3740 is building a legacy of participation in the Order of the Arrow. Numerous youth and adult members have participated in lodge training, fellowships, conclaves, and accomplished some of the toughest jobs in the lodge. It is fully expected that the Order of the Arrow will continue to be a large part of the program of this troop.
