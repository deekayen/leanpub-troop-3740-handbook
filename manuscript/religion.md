# Religious Principles

The Boy Scouts of America has a definite position on religious principles. The following interpretative  statement may help clarify this position.

1. The Boy Scouts of America does not define what constitutes belief in God or the practice of religion.
2. The Boy Scouts of America does not require membership in a religious organization or  association for enrollment in the movement but does prefer, and strongly encourages, membership and participation in the religious programs and activities of a church, synagogue, or other religious association.
3. The Boy Scouts of America respects the convictions of those who exercise their constitutional freedom to practice religion as individuals without formal membership in organized religious  organizations. In a few cases, there are those who, by conviction, do not feel it necessary to formally belong to an organized form of religion and seek to practice religion in accordance with their own personal convictions. Religious organizations have commended the Boy Scouts of America for encouraging youth to participate in organized religious activities. However, these  same organizations reject any form of compulsion to enforce conformity to established religious practices.
4. If a scout says they are a member of a religious body, the standards by which they should be evaluated are those of that group. This is why the application for the Eagle Scout Award requests a reference from his religious leader to indicate whether he has lived up to their expectations.

Throughout life, Scouts are associated with people of different faiths. Scouts believe in religious freedom, respecting others whose religion may differ from theirs. Scouting believes in the right of all to worship God in their own way.

If a Scout has specific needs to observe his religious duty to God, please make the Scoutmaster aware of this immediately. If we are away for a full weekend outing, we may observe a "Scout's Own" service. This is a chapel type service that is planned and executed by the youth of our troop.

Once a year the Boy Scouts of America has a national day of recognition called "Duty to God" Sunday. This is a special day set aside for troops to celebrate together our Duty to God.

We ask every scout to be tolerant of those with beliefs different than their own, and we are tolerant of their beliefs.

The troop asks every parent and every scout to understand that the Church of the Good Shepherd is our  chartered organization. Among some of the sacrifices that they make for us are allowing us to use  meeting rooms, fellowship hall, and they provide insurance for our trailer. Since a Scouts BSA troop cannot own property, without a chartered organization, a Scout organization such as our troop, cannot exist.

Therefore, we ask every Scout in our troop to make every effort to show up at the Church of the Good  Shepherd once a year during Scout Sunday and show the Church how much we appreciate all of the help  they give us through the year.

We understand that in our troop we have scouts of many different faiths. We understand that scouts and parents may feel uncomfortable attending a worship service at the Catholic Church. However, we hope to teach the scouts many valuable lessons by attending the Duty to God service.

By attending a worship service of different faiths we are teaching scouts to be tolerant of faiths other than  their own. We are teaching them that they can worship with people of different faiths while maintaining true to their own faith. We are teaching them to be appreciative of the sacrifices of others such as the Catholic Church. We recognize that we not only have a duty to thank God for the many blessings he bestows upon us, but we also have a duty to thank the members of the religious organization that God uses to bless us. One of the biggest ways we can thank them is to show up.
