# Finances and Fundraisers

Troop 3740 supports its activities through fundraisers, annual registration fee and troop dues.

In December, the annual BSA registration fee covering council registration fees, subscriptions to Scouts Life Magazine, and insurance is collected, along with annual troop dues.

When writing checks for dues, expenses, or other purposes, please make checks payable to "BSA Troop 3740." Fees associated with returned checks due to insufficient funds will be charged to the individual for reimbursement.

Each Scout within Troop 3740 has their own Scout account. A percentage of most fundraising sales stay with a boy in their Scout account. A Scout can utilize monies from his Scout account to pay for monthly outings, summer camp or even registration/Troop dues. Parents should require Scouts to earn the money to pay for Scouting events. This process of earning their way is an important character builder. If the Scout leaves the Troop or does not recharter any remaining funds are moved to the Troop general fund.

If any financial hardship arises, please see either the Scoutmaster or committee chairperson.
