# Board of Review

At the board of review, the Scout should be prepared to discuss skills learned on all earned ranks as well as the rank being earned. The Scouts should also be prepared to discuss basic skills and current events. They are held during a regularly scheduled troop meeting and are conducted by at least three adults. If a Scout cannot attend his board of review, he must make other arrangements with the Committee Chair or Scoutmaster. Scouts going before a board of review must be in Class A uniform. Wearing more formal regalia, such as a neckerchief and merit badge sash is proper.
